# orr

`orr` is a bash utility to view public TV in Germany.

## Usage

First you need to import the channels by running `orr-update`.
After that, you can use `orr` to get a selection list of what to watch and when
you hit `CR`, the `mpv` player opens with that stream.

You can specify `QUALITY=max orr` for a higher quality stream.
